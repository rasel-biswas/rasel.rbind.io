<p>Let’s begin with a simple question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If 50 students are admitted to ISRT each year, what is the probability that at least 2 of them have the same birthday, that is, they can share the same birthday cake? Pause for a moment and guess the probability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is <span class="math inline">\(97\%\)</span>. Yes, you read that right, <span class="math inline">\(97\%\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0.97\)</span> is the probability that at least <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> people out of <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> share a birthday.</p>
<p>-Seems impossible, doesn’t it? How can the probability be that high? That was certainly my reaction when I first heard about the Birthday Paradox (as it has come to be known). If you ask people to guess the probability, they tend to go for ‘<span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\(365\)</span>’, or possibly a slightly higher probability. But hardly anyone guesses as high as <span class="math inline">\(97\%\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are different ways of explaining it, and many versions can be found on the internet. But here’s a simple way to understand it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Imagine, you’re the first person in a room. Then a second person comes in. The probability that the person shares your birthday is <span class="math inline">\(1/365\)</span> (let’s forget about leap years for now).</p></li>
<li><p>A third person enters. The probability that the third person shares your birthday is also <span class="math inline">\(1/365\)</span>. So the probability that either of those two people share your birthday is <span class="math inline">\(2/365\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>BUT, this is where you tend to forget about - there is also a chance that the second and third people will share each other’s birthday. So the probability of a shared birthday is slightly higher than you thought at first. Think of the possible links - the possibilities of a shared birthday - as the three sides of a triangle.</p></li>
<li><p>Then a fourth person enters the room. The possible links are now the four sides of a square, plus the two diagonals (so totally <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> links). A fifth person gives you a five-sided shape - join all its points to each other and you’ll get <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> links. See how the numbers are starting to grow!</p></li>
<li><p>By the time you reach <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> people, there are <span class="math inline">\(1,225\)</span> possible links (since, <span class="math inline">\({50 \choose 2}=1225\)</span>). You can find the exact math on the internet, but see all of a sudden that high probability instinctively feels right, doesn’t it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the exact math is:</p>
<p>Probability (at least one matched pair)<span class="math inline">\(=1\)</span> - Probability (no matched pair out of 1,225 pairs)
<span class="math display">\[
=1-(364 / 365)^{1225}=0.965
\]</span></p>
<p>Other Interesting things you can relate now are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Once you have only <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span> people there is a <span class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span> chance of a shared birthday.</p></li>
<li><p>If you get to <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span> people, then there is a <span class="math inline">\(70\%\)</span> chance of a shared birthday.</p></li>
<li><p>And, in a room of <span class="math inline">\(75\)</span>, there is a <span class="math inline">\(99.9\%\)</span> chance of at least two having the same birthday.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best demonstrations of this paradox (of <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span> people) was at the <span class="math inline">\(2014\)</span> FIFA World Cup. Someone analyzed the <span class="math inline">\(32\)</span> teams (all containing <span class="math inline">\(23\)</span> players, remember), and found that in <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> teams there were at least two players with the same birthday.</p>
<p>One important thing is that the birthday paradox isn’t a logical paradox since there’s nothing self-contradictory about it, it’s just unexpected at first sight.</p>
<p>So next time you’re in a classroom, at a party, or playing cricket or football, conduct your own experiment.</p>
