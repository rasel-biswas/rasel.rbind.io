I am a lecturer of Applied Statistics at the University of Dhaka. I graduated from the University of Dhaka with a B.S. in Applied Statistics and then received an M.S. in Applied Statistics from the same university. I teach courses on design and analysis of experiments, lifetime data analysis, and R programming. My research interests include missing data, multiple imputation, and design of experiments.
