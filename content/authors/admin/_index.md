I graduated from the University of Dhaka with a B.S. in Applied Statistics and then received an M.S. in Applied Statistics from the same university.
I am a fan of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/), and I have been using it for statistical analysis for more than 5 years. I worked as a Teaching Fellow for the Biostatistics course in the Master of Public Health (MPH) Programme at BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University.
